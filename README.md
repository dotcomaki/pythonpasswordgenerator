Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Additionally, you'll need to install the `pyperclip` library to enable copying generated passwords to the clipboard. You can install it using `pip`:
```
pip install pyperclip
```
